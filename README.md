Since I have an important Course(Computer Vision) this semester. To improve the skill in CV, I will learn knowledge about how to use opencv and significant algorithm in CV.

I clone one interesting project [gzr2017/ImageProcessing100Wen](https://github.com/gzr2017/ImageProcessing100Wen) which provide 100 problems. It will be great help for me to understand the algorithm. 

Besides I find some courses in famous university such as cs131.



## TODO

1. Course Homework and Report.
2. Implement of 100 problems.
3. Course Notes and assign in [cs131 learning](<http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1920/syllabus.html>)
